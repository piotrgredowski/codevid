Welcome to this tutorial on successfully logging into the application! In this video, you'll learn how to navigate through the login process using valid credentials for a seamless entry to your dashboard.

How to do it: We'll start by navigating to the login page, enter our credentials, and finally verify that we're welcomed into our dashboard.

First, you'll want to navigate to the login page by entering the URL 'http://localhost:5001/login' in your browser. This is where you'll begin the login process. Give this a couple of seconds to load completely.

Once the page has loaded, wait for the email input field to appear. It's important that this area is visible before proceeding. This might take a second.

Now, click into the email field and type 'demo@example.com'. This input is crucial as it identifies who you are in the system.

Next, move to the password field and enter 'password123'. Make sure your typing is accurate here to avoid errors.

With your credentials filled in, click the 'Submit' button to advance. This tells the system to process your login information.

After submitting, wait for the transition to the dashboard to confirm a successful login. This redirection indicates you've been authenticated.

Finally, check for the welcome message on your dashboard. The message should read, 'Welcome back, Demo! You have successfully logged in.' This verifies your login was successful.

And that's it! You've now seen how to log into the application seamlessly. Following these steps ensures you can access your dashboard quickly and efficiently every time.
