Welcome to this tutorial on successfully
logging into the application! In this

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,493
video, you'll learn how to navigate
through the login process using valid

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:12,790
credentials for a seamless entry to your
dashboard.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,539
How to do it: We'll start by navigating
to the login page, enter our credentials,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,789
and finally verify that we're welcomed
into our dashboard.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,626
First, you'll want to navigate to the
login page by entering the URL

7
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:31,163
'http://localhost:5001/login' in your
browser. This is where you'll begin the

8
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:35,700
process. Give this a couple of seconds to
load completely.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,414
Once the page has loaded, wait for the
email input field to appear. It's

10
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:44,829
that this area is visible before
proceeding. This might take a second.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,030
Now, click into the email field and type
'demo@example.com'. This input is crucial

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,929
as it identifies who you are in the
system.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,000
Next, move to the password field and
enter 'password123'. Make sure your typing

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,770
accurate here to avoid errors.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,490
With your credentials filled in, click
the 'Submit' button to advance. This tells

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,910
the system to process your login
information.

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,410
After submitting, wait for the transition
to the dashboard to confirm a successful

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,610
login. This redirection indicates you've
been authenticated.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,446
Finally, check for the welcome message on
your dashboard. The message should read,

20
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:23,983
'Welcome back, Demo! You have
successfully logged in.' This verifies

21
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,520
successful.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,356
And that's it! You've now seen how to log
into the application seamlessly.

23
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,893
Following these steps ensures you can
access your dashboard quickly and

24
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:38,430
every time.
